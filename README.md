# bubbleCursor-usertesting

Paper implemented: The bubble cursor: enhancing target acquisition by dynamic resizing of the cursor's activation area

I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment. This was an absolute individual effort on my part.

Sequence of tasks:
1. Click on start.
2. Start clicking on the green target on each screen. The user will see his/her progress at the bottom of the screen throughout the experiment.
3. The user will get to use both pointer and bubble cursor.
4. Once the experiment is complete, fill out the survey in the end in the form of a Google form.

The experimental parameters in my implementation are as follows:
1. Number of blocks
2. Number of trials
3. Cursor Type
4. Density
5. Amplitude
6. Width
7. Effective Width/Width ratio

For each trial run, block number, trial number, cursor type, density, amplitude, width, effective width/width ratio, movement time and errors are recorded in a comma separated format in a Google spreadsheet.

As part of user's demograpic information, following questions are asked in a survey at the end of the experiment:
1. Gender
2. Age
3. Right-handed or left-handed?
4. Which hand did you use during the experiment: right or left?

The survey was in the format of a Google form.
